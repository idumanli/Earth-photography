      <h1 class="w3-center">About Photographer</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-center">I was born in Istanbul in 1978. I have lived in Istanbul for my entire education and my corporate business life, which has been going on for many years. When my son (can Mehmet) was born in 2010, I heve started to take pictures of him as a hobby, and when I started photography training and got my own camera, it was my biggest dream to turn the photography into my work. I had the opportunity to advance my hobby by shooting near me for a long time. In 2019, my interest in photography and the desire to pursue our dreams as a family with 40 years of age was the first step of my dream in the UK with Earth Photography, leaving both my corporate business life and the country I live in. About to meet you through my own lens.</p>
